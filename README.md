##  Business Problem

Despite steady growth in revenue and profit from 2021 to 2023, the company struggled to:
- Maintain consistent performance across **sales channels**.  
- Identify **which products and regions** contribute the most to profit.  
- Understand **seasonal sales fluctuations** and their effect on revenue.  
- Optimize **marketing and operational expenses** for higher ROI.  

By 2023, management noticed:
- A **7% drop in Q4 sales**,  
- Increasing **operational costs** in retail stores, and  
- Slower **new customer acquisition rates** (down by ~2%).  

The goal of this analysis was to build an **interactive dashboard** to identify **growth opportunities**, **optimize sales strategies**, and **quantify actionable recommendations** to increase profitability in 2024 and beyond.

---

## Dashboard Insights 
#  Sales Performance Dashboard Analysis – 2024
**Tracking Activewear Sales Performance and Optimizing Growth with Real-Time Insights**

<img width="593" height="357" alt="SC1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a443e9-b087-4776-8cdd-654370ffedc1" />




---

##  Key Metrics Summary

In 2024, the business achieved **$248K in revenue**, representing an **8.22% year-over-year increase**.  
**Total profit** reached **$75K**, growing by **8.33%**, slightly outpacing revenue — a positive indicator of margin improvement or better operational efficiency.  

**5,000 units** were sold, showing a **5.72% increase**, while the **customer base** rose modestly to **2,000 (+3.3%)**.  

These trends indicate that most revenue gains stemmed from **existing customers** and **higher average order values**, not from a significant expansion of new customers.

---

## Monthly Profit Trends

Profit peaked in **February, May, and June**, then declined towards **November and December**.  

This seasonal pattern suggests that early and mid-year months align with higher activewear demand — possibly due to fitness resolutions and summer activities — while year-end performance drops as competition increases.  

To maintain consistent growth, **targeted Q4 promotions** and product bundles should be implemented to sustain revenue momentum during slower months.

---

##  Sales Channel Insights

Among the channels, **marketplaces** delivered the **highest profitability**, confirming strong digital visibility and brand presence.  
The **online store** performed steadily, indicating a loyal customer base but with untapped potential for marketing automation and conversion optimization.  

**Retail stores** maintained moderate sales, while **pop-ups and events** underperformed — suggesting that their costs outweigh their contribution. Redirecting resources from low-return events into high-performing digital channels can yield better ROI.

---

##  Regional Performance

The **South and West regions** generated the highest profit, while **Midwestern and Northeastern states** lagged behind.  
This uneven performance points to opportunities for targeted marketing expansion.  

Localized advertising, influencer partnerships, and region-specific promotions could help boost brand awareness and increase profitability by up to **20% in low-performing states**.

---

##  Insights and Recommendations

The business is on a solid growth path, but several actionable opportunities exist to strengthen overall performance.

**1. Increase Customer Acquisition**  
Customer growth (3.3%) lags behind profit growth (8.3%). Launch targeted digital marketing and referral programs to attract new customers.  
 *Goal:* Achieve a **10% increase in new customers within six months.**

**2. Strengthen Q4 Performance**  
Address the year-end profit dip through seasonal offers, limited-edition collections, and holiday campaigns.  
 *Goal:* Generate **15% more Q4 revenue year-over-year.**

**3. Optimize Sales Channels**  
Reallocate 10% of event marketing budget toward online ads and marketplace expansion.  
 *Goal:* Improve online store profit by **12%.**

**4. Expand Regionally**  
Focus growth efforts on underperforming states through location-based ads and partnerships.  
*Goal:* Boost regional profits by **20%.**

**5. Enhance Customer Retention**  
Introduce a loyalty and rewards program to increase repeat purchases and lifetime value.  
*Goal:* Grow repeat purchase rate by **15%.**

**6. Leverage Peak Months for Premium Products**  
Introduce limited-edition or premium items during February–June when profits are highest.  
 *Goal:* Increase profit margin by **10%** in peak periods.

If these recommendations are applied, the company can expect around **15% overall growth within 12 months**, resulting in an estimated **$285K in revenue** and **$86K in profit**.

---

##  Recommendations

1. **Boost Marketing for Declining Products:**

5. **Data-Driven Pricing Strategy:**  
   Reassess pricing for underperforming categories. A **5% reduction in price** for leggings and socks, supported by targeted discounts, can stimulate demand without eroding margins significantly.

---

##  Summary

Overall, the dashboard highlights a positive sales trajectory with notable strength in high-margin categories and specific regional advantages. Strategic adjustments in underperforming products and expansion into underleveraged sales channels can collectively improve the total profit by **up to 12%** within the next fiscal year.

---

##  Key Insights

- **Overall Growth Snapshot:**  
  The company achieved **$248K in revenue** and **$75K in total profit**, marking **8.22%** and **8.33%** year-over-year growth respectively.  
  These results are backed by a **5.72% increase in sales quantity** and **3.30% growth in total customers**, suggesting strong expansion in customer reach and engagement.

  - **Arizona** saw the **largest profit increase (+212.46%)**, signaling effective market penetration and higher brand recognition in the region.  
  - **California** recorded a **71.37% growth in profit**, driven by both volume and customer growth, making it a high-value state for continued investment.  
  - **Arkansas** also performed impressively with **+56.50% profit growth**, despite modest customer figures.

- **Underperforming States:**  
  - **Connecticut (-81.73%)**, **Colorado (-61.59%)**, and **Alabama (-41.42%)** all faced significant declines in YoY profit.  
  - These states collectively represent a **potential profit loss exceeding $8K–$10K** if the negative trends continue unchecked.

- **Regional Sales Trend:**  
  Monthly performance indicates that **February, June, and September** were the highest-performing months, suggesting seasonality impacts tied to promotional campaigns or activewear demand cycles.  
  Revenue dips observed in **November and December** highlight potential issues with end-of-year retention or post-sale engagement.

- **Sales Channel Consistency:**  
  The **Marketplace** channel remains the core revenue driver across all states. However, over-reliance on a single channel increases risk exposure, especially in underperforming states.

---

##  Recommendations

1. **Revitalize Underperforming States:**  
   Introduce **state-specific marketing campaigns** in Alabama, Colorado, and Connecticut. A **targeted spend of $3K–$5K per state** could boost brand visibility and recover at least **10–15% of lost profit** within the next two quarters.

2. **Leverage High-Growth Regions:**  
   Reinforce supply and partnerships in **Arizona, California, and Arkansas** to sustain momentum. Scaling inventory and localized promotions by **10–12%** could yield an additional **$6K–$8K in quarterly profit**.

3. **Diversify Sales Channels:**  
   Expand beyond marketplaces by integrating direct-to-consumer (D2C) eCommerce and regional retail pop-ups. A **15% diversification** effort could improve overall revenue stability and reduce channel risk.

4. **Seasonal Strategy Adjustment:**  
   Launch pre-season campaigns ahead of **February and June**, the strongest historical months, to maximize conversion rates.  
   A well-timed campaign during these peaks could add **5–7% additional monthly revenue**.

5. **Customer Retention Focus:**  
   Implement loyalty programs or localized promotions to strengthen customer engagement in low-retention states. Improving retention by **5%** can increase total profitability by **20–25%** due to repeat purchases.

---

##  Summary

The Locations Dashboard uncovers strong regional variations in profitability and growth. While high-performing states like **Arizona and California** lead the momentum, underperforming regions offer substantial room for recovery.  
By optimizing regional campaigns, diversifying channels, and addressing seasonality patterns, the company can realistically achieve a **10–15% increase in total profit** across all states in the next fiscal cycle.

- **State-Level Trends:**  
  - **Arizona, Texas, and Hawaii** show repeat order appearances across multiple sales channels, indicating strong customer engagement and regional loyalty.  
  - **Low-performing states** such as **New Hampshire** and **Kentucky** recorded the lowest profit margins (below **$20 per order**), suggesting a need for market development or pricing recalibration.

- **Product Highlights:**

---

##  Recommendations

1. **Expand Profitable Sales Channels:**

2. **Boost Underperforming States:**  
   Focus on targeted promotions and collaborations in **New Hampshire** and **Kentucky**. A modest **$2K marketing investment per state** could improve visibility and yield an additional **10% growth in regional sales**.

3. **Rebalance Channel Strategy:**  
   Prioritize hybrid sales models that combine **Online Stores** with **localized Retail experiences**. This approach can enhance trust and conversion, increasing order value by an estimated **8–10%**.

4. **Product Strategy Refinement:**  
   Introduce **bundled discounts** for low-margin categories like **Socks and Leggings** to encourage bulk sales. A **bundle strategy** could lift their overall profitability by **5–7%** without lowering brand perception.

5. **Data-Driven Order Optimization:**  
   Develop predictive order analysis to identify repeat high-value buyers from states like **Texas and Arizona**. Personalized promotions for these regions could yield **up to 15% higher repeat order rates**.

---

##  Summary

The Orders Dashboard highlights that **profitability is driven by a mix of product strategy and sales channel effectiveness**. Retail and pop-up channels deliver higher per-order margins, while marketplaces ensure consistent sales volume.
